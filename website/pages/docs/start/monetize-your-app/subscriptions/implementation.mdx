:::tip About Subscriptions
This page discusses the Tebex-based Overwolf Subscriptions API and its specific implementation details.

:::

The Overwolf Subscriptions API is a set of endpoints, allowing App developers to easily integrate
subscriptions into their Apps, using [Tebex Checkout](https://www.tebex.io/).
Apps using this API can then access a simple subscriptions management system, without needing to worry
about processing payments and keeping track of subscription statuses, and without the need for any server-side logic.

## Getting Started

import Setup from "@site/pages/docs/api/general/subscriptions-api/_setup.mdx"

<Setup/>

## Implementation

*Full API documentation is available [here](/api/general/subscriptions-api).*

In order to actually implement subscriptions in your App, you need to implement the following three general flows:
- Check the current status of all [active subscriptions](/api/general/subscriptions-api#subscriptions), and affect the App properly.
- Fetching a list of available [subscription plans](/api/general/subscriptions-api#packages).
- Generate a Tebex [Checkout link](/api/general/subscriptions-api#checkout) to let a user pay for a plan they want.

The exact implementation may vary drastically between Apps, in the same way that the plans themselves may differ. However,
usually, it'll act in the following way:
- On App launch, check for the current subscription status, and initialize the different features accordingly.
- In a specific section of the App, show users a listing of all available subscription plans.
- If they choose to purchase a specific plan, open the relevant checkout link for them in their browser, where they can purchase it.
- Periodically, and especially after a successful subscription purchase, re-check the current subscription status, and change the App's behavior accordingly.

### Sample App

For an example implementation of the Overwolf Subscriptions API, see the [relevant sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/tebex-subs-sample).
