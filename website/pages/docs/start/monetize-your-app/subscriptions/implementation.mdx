:::tip About Subscriptions
This page discusses the different available Subscriptions APIs and their specific implementation details.

<SkipMe type="TODO">

If you haven't already, do also check out [**Subscriptions Guidelines**][guidelines], for an overview
of what working with Subscriptions entails on the App design level.

</SkipMe>

:::

The Overwolf Subscriptions APIs are several sets of endpoints, allowing App developers to easily integrate
subscriptions into their Apps, using [Tebex Checkout](https://docs.tebex.io/developers).
Apps using this API can then access a simple subscriptions management system, without needing to worry
about processing payments and keeping track of subscription statuses, and without the need for any server-side logic.

## Getting Started

To get started, it is important to choose the right API for you and your use-case

<SubscriptionsComparisonTable/>

import OverwolfSetup from "./_partials/_overwolf_setup.mdx"

<SkipMe type='TODO'> Add "I am a, I should use b" section </SkipMe>

<Tabs groupId="subscription">
<TabItem value="overwolf" label="Overwolf Subscriptions" >

<OverwolfSetup/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="headless" label="Tebex Headless">

The Tebex Headless API works by exposing several endpoints, allowing you to easily
create baskets, manage the packages within them, and eventually produce a checkout link for the
user to pay in, directly within your App.

However, you will still need to run your own backend server to receive webhooks
on purchase updates, as well as manage the current subscription statuses for your different users.

For more information on implementing the Tebex Headless API, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.tebex.io/developers/headless-api/overview)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="checkout" label="Tebex Checkout">

The Tebex Checkout API works by exposing the raw endpoints used for any payment processing,
giving you full control over the entire subscription flow, at the cost of requiring a dedicated
backend server to manage every single part of it, with which your App and or website will interact.

For more information on implementing the Tebex Checkout API, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.tebex.io/developers/checkout-api/overview)

*\* Note that currently, the Tebex Checkout API is still considered in beta. To get started using it, please [contact Tebex Support](https://www.tebex.io/contact-customer?category=7)*

## Implementation

<SkipMe type="TODO">
Make the links below change to the relevant link per subs api.
</SkipMe>

*Full API documentation for the Overwolf Subscriptions API is available [here](/api/general/subscriptions-api).*

In order to actually implement subscriptions in your App, you need to implement the following three general flows:
- Checking the current status of all [active subscriptions](/api/general/subscriptions-api#subscriptions), affecting the App properly.
- Fetching a list of available [subscription plans](/api/general/subscriptions-api#packages).
- Generating a Tebex [Checkout link](/api/general/subscriptions-api#checkout) to let a user pay for a plan they want.

The exact implementation may vary drastically between Apps, in the same way that the plans themselves may differ. However,
usually, it'll act in the following way:
- On App launch, check for the current subscription status, and initialize the different features accordingly.
- In a specific section of the App, show users a listing of all available subscription plans.
- If they choose to purchase a specific plan, open the relevant checkout link for them in their browser, where they can purchase it.
- Periodically, and especially after a successful subscription purchase, re-check the current subscription status, and change the App's behavior accordingly.
