:::tip About Subscriptions
This page discusses the Tebex-based Overwolf Subscriptions API and its specific implementation details.

<SkipMe type="TODO">

If you haven't already, do also check out [**Working with Ads**][working-with-ads], for an overview
of what working with Ads entails on the app design level.

:::

The Overwolf Subscriptions API is a set of endpoints, allowing App developers to easily integrate subscriptions using the [Tebex Checkout](https://www.tebex.io/)
system into their Apps.
Overwolf then manages these subscriptions automatically, providing the App with the subscription status of the current user.

## Getting Started

import Setup from "@site/pages/docs/api/general/subscriptions-api/_setup.mdx"

<Setup/>

## Example Implementation

:::tip WIP
This section of the documentation is an active work in progress. In the meantime, we have included everything you need to get started
with implementing subscriptions in your App, as we work towards refining this documentation with your feedback!
:::

For an example implementation using the Overwolf Subscriptions API, see the [relevant sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/tebex-subs-sample).

## Guidelines for Subscriptions integration

If you haven't already, please give a read to [Ad planning guidelines](working-with-ads#ad-planning-guidelines).

Apart from those, there are also certain things you should keep in mind when interacting with the actual Ad containers, on a more technical front:

- Your Ad container's minimum width and height should be >= The largest Ad container size selected for this container.
- Your Ad container element should have no child elements apart from the one generated by the SDK.
- Your Ad container should have a [placeholder background graphic](#ad-container-placeholders), to ensure that the container's area is never empty, even when no Ads are currently displayed.
- Your Ad container should ALWAYS be visible in the app screen.
  - _For specific cases where you wish to **temporarily** stop displaying Ads, you can set the `display` css property of the Ad's_
    _ container to `none`. This will stop the container from displaying Ads, until it is made to display again._
- If a window has multiple views, make sure its Ads containers do not change/refresh when moving between different menus/pages/views.
  - If you must specifically change these containers, **do not recycle them!** Instead, shut each changed container down, and open a new one in the new target location!
- Your Ad container should have no scrollbars, and should not be scrollable.
- Once a new OwAd object is created, you should **NEVER** modify any of its containers' CSS properties. The only property you **can** change is `display`, as mentioned in [bullet 4](#:~:text=For%20specific%20cases%20where%20you%20wish%20to%20temporarily%20stop%20displaying%20Ads).
- If you wish to **remove** an Ad container, **you must call [`OwAd.shutdown()`](/api/general/ads-sdk/overwolf-platform/owad#shutdown)!** This is usually done when:
  - You need to change the Ad container - Done by shutting down the current one, and then creating a new one with the new settings/location/parent.
  - You need to remove an Ad container - Done by just shutting down the current one.

<SkipMe type="TODO">
Fix link to "bullet 4", change this all to use numbers and potentially native highlights, and change numbering css
