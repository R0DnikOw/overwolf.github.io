Planning for Ads is hard, especially with so many [sizes](working-with-ads#list-of-ad-sizes) to choose from.

To make it slightly easier, we have devised a list of recommended, optimized Ad Container combinations/layouts, for different app windows
while taking into account the many different factors at play. You can also find a brief summary of each layouts's pros and cons,
as well as a ***(very rough)*** revenue estimate for its performance*, when compared to the baseline layout of its window type**.
With this, we hope to give you a place to foothold to get started.

*\* Revenue estimates are generated based on aggregated performance data across the entire platform, across many countries and setups. Actual milage may vastly differ.*
*\*\* Revenue baselines differ depending on the window type.*

Currently, the following window types are accounted for:
- [Desktop / 2nd screen](#desktop-2nd-screen-windows) - Native, desktop windows, existing outside of a game's context
- [In-Game](#in-game-windows) - In-game, overlay windows, existing only within a game's overlay


:::tip Can't find the right layout for your case?
Try to pick a few you like, and see why they work. Combine, experiment, and most importantly, get feedback from others. We are [always here](/support/contact-us) for
any questions you may have!

Desktop / 2nd screen windows often stay open for long periods of time, with much less competition for screen space.

In-Game windows that display Ads often don't stay open for long periods, and must utilize their screen space as efficiently as possible.
