The Overwolf Subscriptions API works by exposing a few simple endpoints, which the App can then interact with,
in order to perform most common interactions with the [Tebex Checkout API](https://www.tebex.io/).

### Creating an `Overwolf App` Tebex Store

The Tebex Checkout API requires an appropriate "Store" to be defined. To create a store you can use:
* Head to the [Tebex Control Panel](https://accounts.tebex.io/profile),
and make sure you have a registered account.
* Create an [Overwolf App](https://creator.tebex.io/creator-segment/5) type store.

### Setting up subscription plans

The store is now set up, but it still needs to define packages that can be sold. To do that:
* Head to the [Packages](https://creator.tebex.io/packages) page (make sure you're viewing the right store).
* Create a package for every plan you wish to support, supplying it with all the details you want. **If you're using the Overwolf Subscriptions API - make sure to mind the following:**
  * **Pricing** - The package must be set to `Recurring Payment = Charge a recurring subscription`, to ensure that it is an actual subscription.
  * **Limits** - Packages must be limited to `User Limit = 1`, to ensure a user can only have one copy of a package active at any moment.

### Store ID and Private Key (Overwolf Subscriptions API)

In order to [link](#link-store-overwolf-subscriptions-api) your store to the Overwolf API, you will need to know your store's public and private keys.
These can be found in the [API Keys](https://creator.tebex.io/developers/api-keys) page.
- Private Key - A private key, used by the Overwolf Subscriptions API.
- Public Token - Also called Store ID - A public key, used as your store's identifier with the Overwolf Subscriptions API.

### Setting up webhook (Overwolf Subscriptions API)

To make sure that the store is synchronized with the Overwolf Subscriptions API, you need to create a webhook:
* Head to the [Webhooks Endpoints](https://creator.tebex.io/webhooks/endpoints) page (make sure you're viewing the right store).
* First of all - at the bottom of the page, you'll find the `Secret Key`, used for linking your store with the Overwolf Subscriptions API.
* Now, Create a new Endpoint, and mark **ALL** Webhook Types for it.
* For the Endpoint's URL, use `https://subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/tebex-webhooks/${YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN}`.

### Link store (Overwolf Subscriptions API)

To finish linking your Tebex Store with the Overwolf Subscriptions API, [contact us][contact-us]. **You will then be asked to provide the following:**
* [Private Key + Public Token](#store-id-and-private-key-overwolf-subscriptions-api).
* [Webhook Token](#setting-up-webhook-overwolf-subscriptions-api)
* App ID - The Overwolf App ID of the App this store is made for.
* App deeplink scheme - The [custom scheme](/api/manifest#url_protocol-object) used for redirecting back into your App from the subscription checkout flow.

The app must first [set up](#setting-up-the-ads-sdk) the Ads SDK. This will then define the [`OwAd`][owad] variable,
which can then be instantiated. Instantiating an [`OwAd`][owad] will link it to a specific DOM element,
which will then become a Managed Ads Container.

:::info Multiple Ad containers
If you wish to show more than one ad in your app, you can easily do so by creating multiple instances
of [`OwAd`][owad]. Just make sure you pass a different container element for each instance,
and that you properly comply with our [acceptable Ads policy][acceptable-ads].

### Setting up the Ads SDK

<TabItem value="electron-platform" label="Overwolf Electron">

The Ads SDK comes built into the [ow-electron](/tools/ow-electron) package. As such, the app only needs
to create an `<owadview/>` component, which then acts as a managed Ad container.

:::info Multiple Ad containers
If you wish to show more than one ad in your app, you can easily do so by creating multiple instances
of the `<owadview/>` component. Just make sure that you properly comply with our [acceptable Ads policy][acceptable-ads].
