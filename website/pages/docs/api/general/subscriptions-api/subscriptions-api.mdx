The [Overwolf Subscriptions API](/start/monetize-your-app/subscriptions) relies on a combination of endpoints and deeplinks, detailed in this page.

## Endpoints

The following is a list of endpoints exposed by the Overwolf Subscriptions API, to handle the most common operations.

### Checkout

> Generates a checkout page for a specific subscription plan (package).

import Checkout from '@site/pages/docs/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_checkout.mdx'

<Checkout/>

*This request redirects directly to the page, and as such, should be opened as a link in the users' browser.*

### Subscriptions

> Returns a list of all active subscription plans (packages) for this App for the relevant user.

import Subscriptions from '@site/pages/docs/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_subscriptions.mdx'

<Subscriptions/>

### Packages

> Returns a list of all available subscription plans (packages) for this App.

import Packages from '@site/pages/docs/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_packages.mdx'

<Packages/>

## Deeplinks

The following is a list of deeplinks used by the Overwolf Subscriptions API, to handle calls back to the application.

### Success

> Invoked when a user successfuly finishes the checkout flow.

```js
`${YOUR_DEEPLINK_SCHEME}://?${TEMP_SESSION_TOKEN}&result=success`
```

### Cancelled

> Invoked when a user cancelled the checkout flow explicitly (does not fire if they closed the tab).

```js
`${YOUR_DEEPLINK_SCHEME}://?result=cancel`
```
