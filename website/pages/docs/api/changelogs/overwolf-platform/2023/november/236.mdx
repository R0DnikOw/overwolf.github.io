### Platform
- OSR (in-game) windows can now opt in to enabling hardware acceleration, using the [`disable_hardware_acceleration`](/api/manifest#extension_window_data-object) flag.
  - *This is still turned off by default, and should only be used if absolutely necessary, as it can have a relatively large performance impact.*
- Apps can now set more than one url scheme, using the new [`schemes`](/api/manifest#url_protocol-object) flag.
  - *The [`scheme`](/api/manifest#url_protocol-object) flag is still supported to maintain backwards compatibility, but is no longer recommended for usage.*

### API
- New API - [`overwolf.settings.hotkeys.getAllApps()`](/api/settings/hotkeys#getallappscallback):
  - Returns all active hotkeys, for all games, across all active Apps + all Overwolf Platform hotkeys.
- Updated API - Added the `disable_auto_shutdown_on_game_exit` field to the [`StreamVideoOptions`](/api/streaming#streamvideooptions-object) object.
  - Allows an App to opt out of having the streaming API's recording engine automatically shut down once a game session
    it was targeting ends, leaving the responsibility for closing it to the App itself.
  - *It is still heavily recommended to shut down the recording engine as soon as you are done with the game it was started for, rather than keeping it around.*
- New API - [`overwolf.extensions.current.getPhasedPercent()`](/api/extensions/current#getphasedpercentcallback-version):
  - Returns the Apps' `Phasing Percentage` for a given version (defaults to the last fully rolled out version).

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where, in some edge cases, the Overwolf Client would not shut down properly when closed.
- Fixed a bug where the App's uninstall window would not open if it wasn't running.
