ow-electron is a solution built on top of [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), aimed at allowing electron apps access to Overwolf APIs.

- [@overwolf/ow-electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/ow-electron) is a package based on the
[electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron) package, adding several new features to it.
- [@overwolf/ow-electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/ow-electron-builder) is a package based on the 
[electron-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder) package, which supports building ow-electron apps.
- [@overwolf/electron-is-overwolf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@overwolf/electron-is-overwolf) - similar to the
[electron-is-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-is-dev) package, allows your app to check whether it's currently running as `ow-electron`, or as a base `electron` app.
