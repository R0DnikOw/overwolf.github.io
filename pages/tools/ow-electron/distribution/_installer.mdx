Your app's user experience starts as soon as the user runs it for the first time. To help you make it a success from the very start,
we have adapted the [Overwolf Installer][ow-installer], making it also work with ow-electron.

This installer can (optionally) handle any of the following:
- Tracking of installation [UTM Parameters](#supported-utm-parameters), which will be shown in your [app's Dashboard](/tools/developers-console/all-applications/dashboard).
- CMP flow introduction (for users living in countries where that is required).
- Desktop shortcut creation (as well as allowing the user to avoid creating one).
- App installation folder control.

*\*Apart from that, most of the installer's text/graphics can be changed/configured to fit your specific app. For more details, see [Overwolf Installer][ow-installer]*.

#### Supported UTM Parameters

[UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters#UTM_parameters) allow your team to better track the installation sources for your app. Currently, the following three parameters are supported in the custom installer:
- `utm_source` - "Identifies which site sent the traffic, and is a required parameter".
- `utm_medium` - "Identifies what type of link was used, such as cost per click or email".
- `utm_campaign` - "Identifies a specific product promotion or strategic campaign".

:::tip Retrieving UTM parameters in runtime
Once the app finishes initializing, its UTM parameters can be retrieved through the API, under the `app.overwolf.utmParams` field.
