Electron comes with a built in [automatic app updater](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/auto-updater), which handles all update-related matters on its own.
However, in order for Electron to be able to automatically update your app, it must be configured with a consistent endpoint it can check against for updates/download updates from.

**For Overwolf Electron apps that choose to use our [App File Hosting](/tools/ow-electron/distribution#app-file-hosting)**, Overwolf handles the maintenance of this endpoint.

#### Setting up the updater endpoint

In order to set up the endpoint, simply add the following to your main .js file:

```js title="Setting up ow-electron auto updates"
const { autoUpdater } = require("electron-updater");
...

autoUpdater.setFeedURL({
  provider: 'generic',
  url: `https://electron-updates.overwolf.com/electron-updates/electron/${your_app_id}`
});
```

#### Using app testing channels

The automatic updater endpoint also supports the usage of [app channels](/tools/developers-console/all-applications/release-management#what-are-release-channels). To set the app to use a specific channel,
simply change the `autoUpdater.channel` property:

```js title="Changing the app channel"
autoUpdater.channel = channel_name;
```

*To go back to the production channel, simply set the channel name to `''`.*
