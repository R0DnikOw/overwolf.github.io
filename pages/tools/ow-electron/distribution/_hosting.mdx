Deploying, distributing, and monitoring an app requires a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).

Overwolf Electron is built to seamlessly integrate with the Overwolf CDN, offering the following capabilities:
- App release file hosting/distribution
- Support for multiple release channels
- Archive of all past releases, including older release files
- App usage analytics (can be turned off)

All of this is then managed from within the [Overwolf Developers' Console](/tools/developers-console).
