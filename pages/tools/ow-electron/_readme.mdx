There is no problem with running both ow-electron and electron side-by-side on the same project. In order to run your app with ow-electron,
you only need to add new start and build scripts in your package.json file:

import StartAndBuild from '../../api/electron/package/_build-and-start.mdx'

<StartAndBuild/>

## Unique App ID

import AppAndAuthorName from '../../api/electron/package/_app-and-author-name.mdx'

*Unique app ids are used for ads optimizations, as well as for optional [anonymous analytics](#anonymous-analytics) reports that you may review on our developer's console.*

<AppAndAuthorName/>

## The owadview tag

import OverwolfAdView from './overwolf-ad-view/_tag.mdx'

<OverwolfAdView/>

## Anonymous Analytics

In order to generate usage reports for your ow-electron app, we collect a small number of anonymous analytics (such as when the app is launched,
and when a certain app's window is shown).

You can disable these analytics with the following piece of code:

```js
import { app } from 'electron';

app.overwolf.disableAnonymousAnalytics();

...

app.whenReady().then(...)
```

:::note Disabling Analytics
App analytics are disabled on a per-session basis. If you wish to completely disable them, you must do so before every app start, when initailizing your app.
