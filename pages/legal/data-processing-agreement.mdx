  4. **CONTROLLER TO PROCESSOR**<br />
    In addition to the requirements and obligation set forth under the DPA and applicable Data Protection Laws, and **solely for the Restricted Purpose** processing, in its role as a Processor, Vendor shall comply with the following:

      1. **Representation and Undertaking:** a party shall process the End User Personal Information only on behalf of and under the instructions of the other party and in accordance with US Data Protection Laws and shall not: (i) Sell or Share the Personal Information; (ii) retain, use or disclose the Personal Information for any purpose other than for a Business Purpose or Restricted Purpose as specified in the Agreement; (iii) combine the End User Personal Information with other Personal Information that it receives from, or on behalf of, another partner, or collects from its own; or (iv) if and to the extent applicable limit the use of its Sensitive Personal Information (**“SPI”**). 

      2. **Sub-processors or Sub-contractors:** The Controller party provides a general authorization to engage sub-processors to the extent the Processor party undertakes it will restrict the onward sub-processor’s access only to what is strictly necessary, and will prohibit the sub-processor from Processing the Personal Information for any other purpose other than for a Business Purpose or Restricted Purpose as specified in the Agreement. The Processor party shall impose contractual obligations as required by US Data Protection Laws on such sub-processors, and shall inform the other party in the event of replacing a sub-processor or engaging a new sub-processor.  

      3. **Audit:** A Controller party has the right to ensure the Processor party is in compliance with US Data Protection Laws. For this purpose, the Processor party, upon receiving a reasonable written request from the Controller party, will make available to the Controller party information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and US Data Protection Laws. To the extent required by applicable US Data Protection Laws, and upon receiving prior written notice, the Processor party will allow audits, including inspections, by the Controller party (or an auditor on its behalf). Any such audit must be tailored to what is reasonably necessary to verify compliance with this DPA, and must occur during normal business hours, and not more than once per calendar year. The results of the audit will be the confidential information of the Processor party. Notwithstanding the above, under US Data Protection Laws and subject to the Developer’s consent, the Processor party may alternately, in response to the Controller party's on-premise audit request to initiate an independent auditing on its own, to verify its compliance with its obligations under US Data Protection Laws and provide the Developer with the results. In any case, the expenses of the audit shall be paid by the Controller party. The Processor party may refuse audit or access to certain information if it determines it may harm other partners or customers, or it may cause a security breach, or it is not related or necessary for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with US Data Protection Laws.

      4. **Certification:** The Processor party certifies that it understands the rules, requirements, and definitions of the CCPA and agrees to refrain from Selling or Sharing Personal Information. The Processor party acknowledges and confirms that it does not receive any monetary goods, payments, or discounts in exchange for processing the Personal Information for a Business Purpose or Restricted Purpose as specified in the Agreement.
