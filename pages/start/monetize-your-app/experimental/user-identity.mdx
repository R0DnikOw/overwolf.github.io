When advertising their products, advertisers often wish to target and track specific audiences,
for whom the Ads are most likely to be effective. To tailor those Ads to specific users,
as well as track their later performance, **"User Identity"** solutions are required.

In the context of Overwolf, and due to [ongoing shifts in the industry](#third-party-cookie-deprecation),
**"Hashed Emails"** are used, letting advertisers identify and target users based on interests,
without ever being exposed to the users' actual identities.

### Third Party Cookie Deprecation

Before **Hashed Emails**, the standard method of tracking user identities for advertising
revolved around [**"Third Party Cookies"**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_cookies).

Google's decision to [deprecate support for **Third Party Cookies**](https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/)
in Chrome, has significantly impacted this method's ability to be used in a scalable manner,
resulting in a larger, industry-wide shift towards alternative solutions.

Here at Overwolf, we have elected to collaborate with several industry-leading
User Identity providers\*, to facilitate the usage of **Hashed Emails**.

Predicting the potential uplift is challenging as it depends on how quickly advertisers embrace these solutions. It's crucial to recognize that the adoption cycle is gradual, with these solutions aimed at long-term benefits. While there's no assurance of immediate performance gains, they play a role in fostering sustained revenue growth.

Email addresses can be valuable for various purposes, including communication with users, personalized marketing, and user authentication. However, it's crucial to ensure that your privacy and security practices comply with privacy regulations and that you are transparent with users about how their email addresses will be used.
