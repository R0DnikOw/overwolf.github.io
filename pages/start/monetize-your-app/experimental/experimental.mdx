:::tip Experimental content ahead!
All Overwolf tools, and especially our monetization tools, go through constant
evolution, as we strive to provide better, more valuable services.

As a part of that effort, this section has been created, to help keep track of ongoing
public monetization experiments.  
**The content here will change more frequently than around most parts of the website, and pages may appear and disappear, as they are either scrapped,
or consolidated into their appropriate sections, as a part of their standardization process.**

## Ongoing experiments

[Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) Ads](experimental/cpa-ads) - A new Ad format, rewarding conversions
rather than exposure, with a focus on creating an actual interaction with the content.
