Instream Advertising is the practice of playing content *within* actual conten,
rather than only outside of/next to it (also known as Outstream Advertising).

In the context of Overwolf, we have recently began testing of a new, Instream advertising format,
targeting places in your App where a video of content will be played, by allowing the App
to show an Ad before starting the video content, as a "preroll" Ad of sorts.

## Technical Specification

The Overwolf [Ads SDK](/start/monetize-your-app/advertising/ads-sdk) allows you to easily create
instream Ads, by utilizing a container element. This container, MUST fit the following criteria:
- The container MUST be transparent, and pass input through (except when an Ad is showing)
- The container MUST ALWAYS be of the same size/location as the video it is "related" to (even if the player is resized/moved)

Apart from that, the video itself also MUST:
- Be longer than 5 seconds
- Be played in a video player bigger than 640x480 pixels (width/height respectively)

### Example Implementation

Assuming the following element structure:
```bash title="Component Structure"
video-content # Controlling the size of all children, who are overlaid on top of eachother
├── video-player # The actual video player
├── instream-container # A transparent, passthrough div to contain the instream Ad
```

The following code should work:

```ts title="Example Implementation"
/** The properties used for Instream Ads */
type InstreamAdProperties = {
  /** Is this an instream Ad. Set to true for this set of properties */
  instream: true;
  /** The duration of the video this instream Ad will be played in */
  streamDurationMs: number;
  /**
   * The number of the video this instream Ad will be played in in the current session
   * 
   * For example:
   * - The first video in a session will be `1`.
   * - The second video in a session will be `2`.
   * - The `n`th video in a session will be `n`.
   */
  streamVideoCount: number;
  /** The volume that should be used for the instream Ad (between 0 and 1, defaults to 1) */
  volume?: number;
}

// Get the container for the Instream Ad Container
const containerElement = document.getElementById(/* 'instream-container' */);

// Create the instream Ad
const instream = new OwAd(containerElement, {
  instream: true,
  streamDurationMs: 10000,
  streamVideoCount: 1,
  volume: 1,
} as InstreamAdProperties)

// Add relevant event listeners.
instream.addEventListener('video_ad_skipped', () => {
  // onAdSkipped();
  shutdown();
});
instream.addEventListener('complete', () => {
  // onAdCompleted();
  shutdown();
});

// The command to shut down the instream Ad once it's been played.
const shutdown = () => instream.shutdown();
```
