Instream Advertising is the practice of playing video Ads **within** actual content,
**in response to a direct user action**, rather than just passively/outside of/next
to the content (which is known as **"Outstream Advertising"**).

In the context of Overwolf, we have recently began testing of a new, Instream
advertising format, which will show a video (with sound) directly within
**existing video players\*** in your App, before the video content itself
(also known as **"[Preroll][preroll] Advertisements"**).

*\* Any video player **within the App** that is fully controlled by the App
(does not include any external video players embedded in the App, like Youtube,
Twitch.tv, or existing video Ad Containers).*

Below is a demonstration:

<OWLottie width='50%' height='50%' data={require('/assets/start/monetize-your-app/experimental/instream-ads/instream-ads.json')} />

## Technical Specification

<Tabs groupId="specifications">
<TabItem value="product-specification" label="Product Specification">

The Overwolf [Ads SDK](/start/monetize-your-app/advertising/ads-sdk) allows you to easily create
instream Ads for your App's video content, utilizing a container element.

**\*This container\*** !MUST fit the following criteria:
- !MUST be transparent, and pass user input through (except when an Ad is showing)
- !MUST ALWAYS be bigger than 640x480 pixels (width/height respectively)
- !MUST ALWAYS have the same size/location as the video player it is "related" to
(even if the player is resized/moved)

**\*The App's video\*** (being played within the container) !MUST fit the following criteria:
- !MUST be longer than 5 seconds
- !MUST ONLY start playing as a result of the user clicking a clearly defined "Play" button

Finally, the **\*Instream Ad\*** itself will !ALWAYS comply with the following:
- !ALWAYS acts as a [Preroll][preroll] Ad to any individual video content
- !ALWAYS starts with sound turned on (users can mute it while it plays)
- !SOMETIMES is skippable (with full lengths usually ranging between 15-30 seconds)
- !SOMETIMES is unskippable (with lengths usually ranging between 5-30 seconds)

### Example Implementation

Assuming the following element structure:
```bash title="Component Structure"
video-content # Controlling the size of all children, who are overlaid on top of eachother
├── video-player # The actual video player
├── instream-container # A transparent, passthrough div to contain the instream Ad
```

The following code should work:

```ts title="Example Implementation"
// Get the container for the Instream Ad Container
const containerElement = document.getElementById(/* 'instream-container' */);

// Create the instream Ad
const instream = new OwAd(containerElement, {
  instream: true,
  streamDurationMs: 10000,
  streamVideoCount: 1,
  volume: 1,
} as InstreamAdProperties)

// Add relevant event listeners.
instream.addEventListener('video_ad_skipped', () => {
  // onAdSkipped();
  shutdown();
});
instream.addEventListener('complete', () => {
  // onAdCompleted();
  shutdown();
});

// The command to shut down the instream Ad once it's been played.
const shutdown = () => instream.shutdown();
```

## Further Reading

Instream Ads, as well as all other Overwolf Ads, are based on [IAB](https://www.iab.com/) standards, which you can read more about [here](https://iabtechlab.com/industry-adoption-of-amended-iab-tech-lab-guidelines-is-vital-to-drive-change/)
