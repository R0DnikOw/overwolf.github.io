Instream Advertising is the practice of playing video Ads **within** actual content,
**in response to a direct user action**, rather than just passively/outside of/next to the content (which is known as **"Outstream Advertising"**).

In the context of Overwolf, we have recently began testing of a new, Instream advertising format,
which will show a video (with sound) directly within **existing video players\*** in your App, before the video content itself (also known as **"Preroll Advertisements"**).

*\* Any video player **within the App** that is fully controlled by the App (does not include any external video players embedded in the App, like Youtube, Twitch.tv, or existing video Ad Containers).*

## Technical Specification

The Overwolf [Ads SDK](/start/monetize-your-app/advertising/ads-sdk) allows you to easily create
instream Ads, by utilizing a container element. This container, MUST fit the following criteria:
- The container MUST be transparent, and pass input through (except when an Ad is showing)
- The container (and video player) MUST ALWAYS be bigger than 640x480 pixels (width/height respectively)
- The container MUST ALWAYS be of the same size/location as the video player it is "related" to (even if the player is resized/moved)

The video itself MUST:
- Be longer than 5 seconds
- Be started as a result of the user clicking a "Play" button

Finally, the Instream Ad itself will:
- ALWAYS act as a Preroll Ad to any individual video
- ALWAYS have sound turned on at the start
- SOMETIMES be skippable (with full lengths usually ranging between 15-30 seconds)
- SOMETIMES be unskippable (with lengths usually ranging between 5-30 seconds)

### Example Implementation

Assuming the following element structure:
```bash title="Component Structure"
video-content # Controlling the size of all children, who are overlaid on top of eachother
├── video-player # The actual video player
├── instream-container # A transparent, passthrough div to contain the instream Ad
```

The following code should work:

```ts title="Example Implementation"
/** The properties used for Instream Ads */
type InstreamAdProperties = {
  /** Is this an instream Ad. Set to true for this set of properties */
  instream: true;
  /** The duration of the video this instream Ad will be played in */
  streamDurationMs: number;
  /**
   * The number of the video this instream Ad will be played in in the current session
   * 
   * For example:
   * - The first video in a session will be `1`.
   * - The second video in a session will be `2`.
   * - The `n`th video in a session will be `n`.
   */
  streamVideoCount: number;
  /**
   * The volume that should be used for the instream Ad (between 0 and 1, defaults to 1) 
   * 
   * Note - If the volume is set to 0, no Ad will be played
   */
  volume?: number;
}

// Get the container for the Instream Ad Container
const containerElement = document.getElementById(/* 'instream-container' */);

// Create the instream Ad
const instream = new OwAd(containerElement, {
  instream: true,
  streamDurationMs: 10000,
  streamVideoCount: 1,
  volume: 1,
} as InstreamAdProperties)

// Add relevant event listeners.
instream.addEventListener('video_ad_skipped', () => {
  // onAdSkipped();
  shutdown();
});
instream.addEventListener('complete', () => {
  // onAdCompleted();
  shutdown();
});

// The command to shut down the instream Ad once it's been played.
const shutdown = () => instream.shutdown();
```

Instream Ads, as well as all other Overwolf Ads, are based on [IAB](https://www.iab.com/) standards, which you can read more about [here](https://iabtechlab.com/industry-adoption-of-amended-iab-tech-lab-guidelines-is-vital-to-drive-change/)
