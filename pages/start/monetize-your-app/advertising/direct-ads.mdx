TL;DR:

- Every so often, Overwolf will start a new Direct Ads campaign. When this happens:
  - The campaign's details, terms, and comission will be published.
  - A set of URLs for assets will be provided.
  - A "target" URL will be provided.
- Apps wishing to participate will then display these assets, directing to the "target" URL on click.
  - The "target" URL MUST only be opened in the users' default browser.
  - The "target" URL MUST NOT open in a way that overtakes focus from an active game.
  - The "target" URL MUST only be opened if the user explicitly clicked on it.
- The assets will remain available until the campaign is ended, and will be removed afterwards.
- We recommend that App developers follow certain guidelines, to ensure the Ad does not become annoying/detrimental to user experience:
  - If showing a pop-up: 
    - Try to use dead moments in the App's lifetime.
    - Do not show it more than X times a day.
    - Do not show it more than Y times total.
    - Close the pop-up if the user clicks on a dedicated x button for it, OR clicks outside the pop-up in the App.
  - Only show high-engagement versions of the assets on desktop.
