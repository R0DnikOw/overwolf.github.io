Planning your app layout with ads can present challenges, particularly due to the wide array of ad [sizes](working-with-ads#list-of-ad-sizes) available.

To simplify this process, we have curated a list of recommended and optimized ad container combinations/layouts. These recommendations consider various factors and aim to maximize advertisers' key performance indicators. Each layout is accompanied by a short summary and a rough estimate of potential revenue performance*.

*\* Revenue estimates are generated based on aggregated performance data across the entire platform, across many countries and configurations.*
