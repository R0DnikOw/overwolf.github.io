Subscriptions offer a way to monetize your app in a more direct approach, for your most dedicated users.

In the following section, we will go over everything you need to know in order to begin implementing subscriptions in your app.

1. To begin, please make sure to go over [Working with Subscriptions](/start/monetize-your-app/subscriptions/guidelines), and plan out how subscriptions should affect your App.
2. Once you're ready, simply follow the [Subscriptions API](/start/monetize-your-app/subscriptions/implementation) implementation guidelines for your platform. Feel free to [contact our team][contact-us]
for any questions or issues you may run into, especially during this step.
3. Once you have finished integrating subscriptions into your App, your users will be able to begin subscribing.
However, if you're yet uncertain or need feedback on your ideas, do not hesitate to [contact us][contact-us].

:::info Demographics
* Advertising budgets are more significant for Tier 1 countries: US, UK, CA, AU, DE.
* If most of your app's users originate from Tier 1 countries, itâ€™s likely that your CPM and yield will be higher.
* We monetize ads in lower tier countries too, but from a revenue perspective, 
our recommendation is to focus your **marketing** efforts on Tier 1 countries to maximize your revenues.
