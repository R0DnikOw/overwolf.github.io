The Overwolf Subscriptions API works by exposing a few simple endpoints, which the App can then interact with,
in order to perform most common interactions with the [Tebex Checkout API](https://docs.tebex.io/developers/checkout-api/overview).

### Sample App

For an example implementation of the Overwolf Subscriptions API, see the [relevant sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/tebex-subs-sample).

### Creating an `Overwolf App` Tebex Store

The Tebex Checkout API requires an appropriate "Store" to be defined. To create a store:
* Head to the [Tebex Control Panel](https://accounts.tebex.io/profile),
and make sure you have a registered account.
* [Contact us](/support/contact-us) to be given a link to create an Overwolf App type store.

### Setting up webhook 

To make sure that the store is synchronized with the Overwolf Subscriptions API, you MUST create a webhook linking the two:
* Head to the [Webhooks Endpoints](https://creator.tebex.io/webhooks/endpoints) page (make sure you're viewing the right store).
* First of all - at the bottom of the page, you'll find the `Secret Key`, used for linking your store with the Overwolf Subscriptions API.
* Now, Create a new Endpoint, and mark **ALL** Webhook Types for it.
* For the Endpoint's URL, use `https://subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/tebex-webhooks/${YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN}`.

### Setting up subscription plans

:::tip Package Deliverables
You MUST first [configure a webhook](#setting-up-webhook) before you can create a package.
:::

The store is now set up, but it still needs to define packages that can be sold. To do that:
* Head to the [Packages](https://creator.tebex.io/packages) page (make sure you're viewing the right store).
* Create a package for every plan you wish to support, supplying it with all the details you want. Keep in mind that:
  * **Pricing** - The package MUST be set to `Recurring Payment = Charge a recurring subscription`, to ensure that it is an actual subscription.

### Store ID and Private Key

In order to [link](#link-store) your store to the Overwolf API, you will need to know your store's public and private keys.
These can be found in the [API Keys](https://creator.tebex.io/developers/api-keys) page.
- Private Key - A private key, used by the Overwolf Subscriptions API.
- Public Token - Also called Store ID - A public key, used as your store's identifier with the Overwolf Subscriptions API.

### Link store

To finish linking your Tebex Store with the Overwolf Subscriptions API, [contact us][contact-us]. **You will then be asked to provide the following:**

```js
{
  // Can be gotten [here](#store-id-and-private-key)
  public_token: '',
  // Can be gotten [here](#store-id-and-private-key)
  private_key: '',
  // Can be gotten [here](#setting-up-webhook)
  webhook_token: '',
  /**
   * Your App's UID.
   * - Overwolf Platform: Can be seen in the Overwolf Packages view window under your App's entry, under the `UID` field
   * - Overwolf Electron: Can be gotten [as follows](https://overwolf.github.io/tools/ow-electron#fetching-your-app-id)
   */
  app_id: '',
  /**
   * Your desired deeplink scheme. This scheme will be used to notify you of the Checkout flow's progress.
   * - Overwolf Platform: Can be set using [url_protocol](https://overwolf.github.io/api/manifest#url_protocol-object)
   * - Overwolf Electron: See [Electron Deeplinks](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/launch-app-from-url-in-another-app)
   */
  deeplink_scheme: '',
}
