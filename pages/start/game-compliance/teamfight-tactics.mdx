<GameInfo gameId={21570} page="compliance" />

Competitive integrity is one of our core values, and we work tirelessly to enforce this value, both in-house and with the cooperation of game developers.

## Riot Games app approval

If you wish to integrate your app with any of Riotâ€™s games,
you are required to seek their approval through their 3rd party [application process](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal#_getting-started).

:::tip
These guidelines hold even if you do not intend to use the Riot API itself.
Do note that apps which reach the publication phase and do not yet possess a Riot approval, will be asked to provide one before proceeding.

## Augments and Legends data

Riot Games is committed to creating a fair environment for all players, while reducing metagaming when possible. As such apps should make sure that they do not:
- Do not display Legend Win rates
- Do not display Augment Win rates
- Do not display Augment average game placements

For more details about this policy, see the relevant [Teamfight Tactics Changelog](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/game-updates/teamfight-tactics-patch-13-12-notes/).
