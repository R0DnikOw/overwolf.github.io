<GameInfo gameId={7314} page="compliance" />

Competitive integrity is one of our core values, and we work tirelessly to enforce this value, both in-house and with the cooperation of game developers.

## Pre-Match Phase Anonymity

Valve is dedicated to prevent metagaming and match-history-based target banning. As such, apps should make sure that when in matchmaking, other players'
Usernames/Steam IDs of other players in the lobby are never shown before the picking phase ends.

Do note that this only applies during the picking phase. More specifically:
- Your own Username/Steam ID does not need to be anonymous to yourself.
- Once the picking phase ends, players will be able to see eachother's Usernames/Steam IDs.
