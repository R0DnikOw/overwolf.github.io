<GameInfo gameId={5426} page="compliance" />

Competitive integrity is one of our core values, and we work tirelessly to enforce this value, both in-house and with the cooperation of game developers.

## Riot Games app approval

If you wish to integrate your app with any of Riotâ€™s games,
you are required to seek their approval through their 3rd party [application process](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal#_getting-started).

:::tip
These guidelines hold even if you do not intend to use the Riot API itself.
Do note that apps which reach the publication phase and do not yet possess a Riot approval, will be asked to provide one before proceeding.

## Champion Select Anonymity

Riot Games is working to prevent metagaming and queue dodging (among other things). As such apps should make sure that
Summoner Names in `Ranked Solo/Duo` champion select should be obfuscated. More specifically:
- All instances of non-party Summoner Names in Champion Select should be replaced with `Ally #` (`Ally 1`, `Ally 2` and so on). This includes:
    - In-lobby text chat.
    - Summoner names displayed inside the draft area.
- Player designations should be consistent for all players in the lobby. (`Ally 1` should refer to the same player on all clients).

Do note that this only applies during Champion Select, and only to players who are not a part of your party. More specifically:
- Your own name is not anonymous to yourself.
- Players who queued in the same party are de-anonymized to each other.
- Once in the loading screen, players will be able to see summoner names.
