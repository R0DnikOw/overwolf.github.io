The **Overwolf Game Events Provider** (**GEP**) is a part of the Overwolf API, capable of providing
Apps with Live Game Data as it changes within a supported game.

This is mainly done using the following two forms of **Game Data** (also sometimes confusingly referred to as **Game Events**):

:::tip Overwolf Electron support
GEP for [ow-electron](/tools/ow-electron) are currently being rolled out over
time. If you would like to use events for any specific game, please [let us know](/support/contact-us)
and we will adjust its rollout accordingly.
:::

## Game Events

The simpler of the two, Game Events fire when a fleeting occurance of interest happens within
the game. When relevant, they may also contain specific data, further describing
the event.

<details>
<summary>Example Game Event</summary>

```json title='A player was just killed, with the username "TestUser"'
{
  "name": "player_killed",
  "data": {
    "username": "TestUser"
  }
}
```

</details>

## Game Info

Game Info describes persistent game data, which updates as the game does. This can
be anything from `player` data, to details of the current `match`, and more.

Game Info is stored in a dictionary, which can be obtained at any time using the API. On top of that,
whenever a relevant Game Info item **changes**, an [`infoUpdated`][infoUpdated] event is fired,
containing the new Game Info data.

### Game Info Resetting

[`infoUpdated`][infoUpdated] events only fire when the Game Info value **changes**.
This means that, in some cases, they could become unreliable for detecting the right
game states, since the game's new state may not have **changed** compared to what it was before.

<details>
<summary>Example Game Info cancellation</summary>

Assume that we have a `score` Game Info. This value is set to `0` at the beginning
of every match.

```json title='A match just started, score was set to "0"'
...
  "score": 0
...
```

Now, it could be possible that a match will end with the `score` still being set to `0`.
As a result, when the next match starts, the `score` will be set to `0`, and will not fire an
[`infoUpdated`][infoUpdated] event.

</details>

To stop this from happening, Game Info resetting exists.

More specifically - when the data is "invalidated", it will be set to an illegal, consistent, meaningless value. That way,
the next time that the data changes to a legal value, it will inherently be different
from the former value, and an [`infoUpdated`][infoUpdated] event will fire.

<details>
<summary>Example Game Info reset</summary>

To stop the issue from the last example from happening, when the match ends,
we set `score`, and any other match-specific data, to `null`:

```json title='First match just ended, score is set to "null"'
...
  "score": null
...
```

Now, when the next match starts, score will change from `null` to `0`, causing an
[`infoUpdated`][infoUpdated] event to properly fire.

```json title='Second match just started, score is set to "0"'
...
  "score": 0
...
```

</details>

## Working with Game Data

In order to streamline utilize the aforementioned concepts, we have created a few
utility APIs, which every Overwolf GEP implementation is built around.

### Game Features

<SkipMe type="TODO">
Tag as "not relevant for sdk games"
</SkipMe>

Often, many separate Game Events and Game Info items may exist, even though
they all relate to the same general functionality (hence `Feature`) in the game.

When interacting with the Overwolf GEP API, Game Features will often be used instead
of the individual Game Event/Game Info item names (for example, when [setting the required Game Features](#set-required-features))

<details>
<summary>Example Game Feature</summary>

For example, one game's `match` may have many different game data items:
- Match settings
- Match score
- Match start/end events
- Etc.

These would often make more sense as several different Game Events & Game Info items,
to make sure that, for example, the currently selected `map`, does not behave as
"updated" every single time that the `score` for one of the teams does.

However, the game data itself, does make much more sense when grouped, and is often
used together. As such, `match` would be defined as a **Game Feature** when communicating
with the Overwolf GEP, grouping within it the different Game Data it refers to.

</details>

### Set Required Features

By default, the Overwolf GEP does not actually listen for any changes in the game.
Instead, different [Game Features](#game-features) have to be specifically subscribed to,
and only then will they actually work/fire.

This has a few perks:
- Direct feedback for the App as to what it can expect in terms of data (*under some circumstances, some Game Features [may become temporarily unavailable](#event-status)*).
- Only required Game Features get fired.
- GEP will not even need to run in games where no App is using it.

However, it does also mean that you **must** set the required Game Features for
your App before GEP beings to work (ideally, as soon as the game itself launches).

:::warning Run order matters!
**In some games, the longer it takes between starting the game and when GEP is registered, the
higher the odds of data issues (missing events, unreliable data, etc) become\*.**  
*\* This is especially critical if the App was started in the middle of a game session.
It is recommended that you show a relevant indication to your users in those cases.*
:::

To set the required features, you must call the relevant API method. More specifically:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="overwolf-platform" label="Overwolf Platform">

In order to subscribe to Game Data on the Overwolf Platform,
simply call\* [`overwolf.games.events.setRequiredFeatures()`](/api/games/events#setrequiredfeaturesfeatures-callback).

*\* Do note that - as mentioned in the method's documentation - at least currently,
this call may fail, even if the game was already started, and it should be retried
several times until it succeeds (or runs out of attempts).*

### Listen for GEP Errors
</SkipMe>

## Event Status

Some events may ocassionally become unavailable. This can be caused by several things:
- Recent game update causing issues
- A request by the relevant game studio to disable this event
- Potential discrepencies/issues found with the events' data/reliability
- Etc

Because the Overwolf GEP integration works across many moving parts like that,
temporary unavailabilty is not a question of "if?", but rather of "when, and for how long?".

However, we have created several different mitigations for this, one of which is the
"Event Status Endpoints". These are public API endpoints supplied by Overwolf,
detailing the current uptime status of individual [Game Features](#game-features)
per game.

Using these endpoints, it is possible for your app to react in real time to the
status of different events, be it:
- Toggle specific app functionality
- Toggle certain less reliable/desirable fallback logic
- Provide users an indication of the potential issues

For more details, see [Verifying events for your app](/topics/using-events/how-to-check-events-status-from-app).
