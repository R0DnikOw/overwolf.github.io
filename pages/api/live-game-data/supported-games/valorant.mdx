Please read the [overwolf.games.events](/api/live-game-data) documentation page to learn how to use Overwolf game events.

## Sample Apps
* [VALORANT game events sample app](https://github.com/overwolf/events-sample-app)

## Available Features


* [gep_internal](#gep_internal)
* [me](#me)

## Game event status

It is highly recommended to communicate errors and warnings to app users. 

Check the current game event status [here](/status/). Alternatively, you can easily check that status from your app itself, [using our API](/topics/using-events/how-to-check-events-status-from-app).

#### *agent* note

Not all agents have their game name match their ID data, since this is an internal name, so take that into account.

Possible agent values:

* "Pandemic_PC_C" = Viper
* "Wraith_PC_C" = Omen
* "Hunter_PC_C" = Sova
* "Thorne_PC_C" = Sage
