## Game event status

It is highly recommended to communicate errors and warnings to app users. 

Check the current game event status [here](/status/). Alternately, you can easily check that status from your app itself, [using our API](/topics/using-events/how-to-check-events-status-from-app).

"Bleed Out" is when something "external" kills you, which is not an enemy player.  
For example, if you are knocked out already, and you are outside of the safe zone, your HP automatically depletes, and when it reaches zero, and you die, you will **Bleed Out**, and the **weaponName** and **action** will return with the "Bleed Out" value.  The same rules apply for the "Caustic" legend gas barrels; if they kill you, you also receive a "Bleed Out."
