Every Overwolf application (ow-electron or Overwolf platform), has a unique app id. This unique id is automatically generated, and is based on the app's name,
and the app's author's name.

In `ow-electron`, these fields correspond to the following fields in the package.json file:
- App name - The `productName` or `name` properties
- App author - The `name` field under the `author` field.

```js title="Partial package.json with the relevant fields"
{
  ...
  "name": "ow-electron-sample-app",
  ...
  "author": {
    "name": "Overwolf"
  },
  ...
  "build": {
    ...
    "productName": "ow-electron-sample-app",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

#### Fetching your app ID

Once your app has loaded, you can fetch the app ID through the API as follows:
```js
import app from 'electron';
...
app.whenReady().then(() => {
  const appID = process.env.OVERWOLF_APP_UID;
});
```

*Note that this environment variable will only exist once the app is ready.*
