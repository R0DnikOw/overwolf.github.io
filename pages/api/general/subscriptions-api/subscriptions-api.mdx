The [Overwolf Subscriptions API](/start/monetize-your-app/subscriptions) relies on a combination of endpoints and deeplinks, detailed in this page.

## Endpoints

The following is a list of endpoints exposed by the Overwolf Subscriptions API, to handle the most common operations.

**For live examples of the different endpoints, please check out the [Tebex Subs Sample App](https://github.com/overwolf/tebex-subs-sample).**

**For live examples of the new categories and upgrade/downgrade endpoint, please check out the [Tebex Subs Sample App on the “upgrade/downgrade-develop” branch](https://github.com/overwolf/tebex-subs-sample/tree/upgrade/downgrade-develop).**

### Checkout

> Generates a checkout page for a specific subscription plan (package).

import Checkout from '@site/../pages/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_checkout.mdx'

<Checkout/>

*This request redirects directly to the page, and as such, should be opened as a link in the users' browser.*

### Subscriptions

> Returns a list of all active subscription plans (packages) for this App for the relevant user.

import Subscriptions from '@site/../pages/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_subscriptions.mdx'

<Subscriptions/>

### Packages

> Returns a list of all available subscription plans (packages) for this App.

import Packages from '@site/../pages/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_packages.mdx'

<Packages/>

### Categories

> Returns a list of all categories and their associated packages available for a specific store in this App.

import Categories from '@site/../pages/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_categories.mdx'

<Categories/>

### Upgrade/Downgrade

> Updates the package tier of a subscription package within a specific category for this App.

import UpgradeDowngrade from '@site/../pages/endpoints/subscriptions-api.overwolf.com/_pgrade-downgrade.mdx'

<UpgradeDowngrade/>

#### Notes for Using the Categories and Upgrade/Downgrade Endpoints:

*   To utilize the new `Categories` endpoint, you **must** create a new category and packages for that category in your Tebex store.
*   If you have users subscribed to the "old" package type (which cannot be upgraded or downgraded), please implement the following UI changes in the subscription settings section of your app:
    *   inform the user that he can’t switch between plans and must cancel his current plan first.
        
    *   Allow the user to cancel his subscription and only then allow him to switch to the new package type that allows for Upgrading/Downgrading their package tier.

*   When subscribing to the new package type, an initial purchase must be made using the `Checkout` endpoint. After the initial subscription, you can query the new `Categories` endpoint to check if the user has an active tier (subscription), and then display the Update/Downgrade buttons accordingly using the `prorate_price`.

## Deeplinks

The following is a list of deeplinks used by the Overwolf Subscriptions API, to handle calls back to the application.

### Success

> Invoked when a user successfuly finishes the checkout flow.

```js
`${YOUR_DEEPLINK_SCHEME}://?result=success`
```

### Cancelled

> Invoked when a user cancelled the checkout flow explicitly (does not fire if they closed the tab).

```js
`${YOUR_DEEPLINK_SCHEME}://?result=cancel`
```
