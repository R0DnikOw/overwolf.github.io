The Ads SDK works by creating simple, Managed Ads Containers, which are then controlled by the SDK, with minimal
intervention from the app.

### Creating a Managed Ads Container

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="overwolf-platform" label="Overwolf Platform">

The app must first [set up](#setting-up-the-ads-sdk) the Ads SDK. This will then define the [`OwAd`][owad] variable,
which can then be instantiated. Instantiating an [`OwAd`][owad] will link it to a specific DOM element,
which will then become a Managed Ads Container.

:::info Multiple Ad containers
If you wish to show more than one ad in your app, you can easily do so by creating multiple instances
of [`OwAd`][owad]. Just make sure you pass a different container element for each instance,
and that you properly comply with our [acceptable Ads policy][acceptable-ads].

<TabItem value="electron-platform" label="Overwolf Electron">

The Ads SDK comes built into the [ow-electron](/tools/ow-electron) package. As such, the app only needs
to create an `<owadview/>` component, which then acts as a managed Ad container.

If you wish to show more than one ad in your app, you can easily do so by creating multiple instances
of the `<owadview/>` component. Just make sure that you properly comply with our [acceptable Ads policy][acceptable-ads].
