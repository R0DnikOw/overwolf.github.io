### Changes to your app’s manifest.json file

#### Required permissions

The Overwolf Advertising library uses Overwolf APIs to improve ad targeting for users. Therefore, you need to add the following [permissions](/api/manifest#permissions-array) to your app’s permissions array:

```json
   "permissions": ["Extensions", "Streaming", "Profile", "GameInfo"]
```
