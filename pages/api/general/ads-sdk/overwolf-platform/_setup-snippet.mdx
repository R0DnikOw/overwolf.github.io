In order to use the Ads SDK within an Overwolf app, you must first fetch it from a [constant endpoint](https://content.overwolf.com/libs/ads/latest/owads.min.js) - `https://content.overwolf.com/libs/ads/latest/owads.min.js`.
Attached is a short example snippet that fetches the SDK, as well as setting up a basic [`OwAd`][owad] instance:

```html title="Fetch the latest version of the Ads-SDK, and make sure it loaded"
<script src="https://content.overwolf.com/libs/ads/latest/owads.min.js" async onerror="onAdsSDKNotLoaded()" onload="onAdsSDKReady()"></script>
<script>
    // Reached if the SDK's script failed to load (took too long, couldn't be found, etc)
    function onAdsSDKNotLoaded() {
        // If this happens, it is up to the app to decide how to proceed.
        console.error("Couldn't load owads.min.js!");
    }

    function onAdsSDKReady() {
        if (!OwAd) {
            // Reached if the SDK's script failed to properly load.
            // If this happens, it is up to the app to decide how to proceed.
            // onAdsSDKNotLoaded();
            return;
        }
        // Reached if the script loaded properly.
        // You can now create however many ad containers you need for this window, granted that they follow the implementation guidelines.
        let adContainer = new OwAd(document.getElementById(/*Insert ad container Id here*/), {/*Mandatory Ad settings*/});
    }

</script>
```

#### Notes regarding the snippet above

* As you can see, the script tag is added with an `async` attribute.
This is because the script should be loaded asynchronously, so that it will not interfere
with the rest of the page's loading.
The downside to this approach, is that the script may take time to load and be ready.  
To overcome this, you should use the `onload` and `onerror` callbacks from the script tag, to be notified as soon as the load succeeded/failed.

* When creating a new [`OwAd`][owad], we provide it with two parameters: A DOM element, and the **required** Ad settings.
In this example we are getting the instance of the element by calling `document.getElementById()`.
However, you may use any other way to get the DOM element. You may use `document.querySelector`,
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/), or any other method you wish - as long as the provided element is an HTML element available
at the DOM, it will work.
:::tip Container Identification
If the Ad container did not already have an element ID defined, it will automatically be assigned one.
