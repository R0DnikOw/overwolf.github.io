This version had two major releases. For clarity, their changelogs were kept separate.

### Platform

- Improved stability of app [Deep Linking](https://overwolf.github.io/api/extensions#the-origin-string).
- App [hotkeys](/api/manifest#hotkeys-object) can now be defined on a per-game basis, using the [game_ids](/api/manifest#hotkeys-object) field.


## Version 0.221.109.x

### Platform
- Updated the underlying [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/master/) version from version 87 to version 109. A detailed breakdown of the underlying changes can be found [here](https://chromestatus.com/features#milestone%3D109).
- Added support for web images in [`overwolf.notifications.showToastNotification()`](/api/notifications#showtoastnotificationargs-callback). Simply pass the image's URL to the [`heroImage`](/api/notifications#heroimage-notes) parameter in the [`ToastNotificationParams`](/api/notifications#toastnotificationparams-object) object.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where an incorrect window state would be detected after maximizing a minimized in-game windows.
- Enabling a disabled app that should launch with the currently-running game will now launch the app automatically.
- Fixed an issue where certain installed games would not be detected by Overwolf, even after using the [`overwolf.games.getGameInfo()`](/api/games#getgameinfogameclassid-callback) or [`overwolf.games.getGameDBInfo()`](/api/games#getgamedbinfogameclassidcallback) methods.
- Maximized in-game windows will now return the right window state after being minimized and then restored.
- Maximized in-game windows will now return to their previous size after being dragged.
