### Platform

- Enabled the CSS pseudo-class [`:where()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where) as experimental.
- Trying to run an unpacked application when logged out will now show an error message.
- Prints attributed to `webpack-internal:\\` will now always be written to the app's logs, even with log filtering enabled.

### API

- New API - [`overwolf.profile.generateUserSessionToken()`](/api/profile#generateusersessiontokencallback):
    - Generates a short lived authentication token for the currently logged-in user.
    - Short lived authentication tokens can be tested against the [relevant endpoint](/api/profile#verify-token-integrity), to prove its legitemacy for an external app,
    as well as be used to [obtain certain details](/api/profile#get-user-profile-via-token) about the linked Overwolf user profile.
- Updated API - [`overwolf.utils.uploadClientLogs()`](/api/utils#uploadclientlogsoptions-note):
    - `UploadClientLogsOptions.filePrefix` must only contain legal characters `(a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _)`, and must contain 64 or less characters in total.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where an app could create more than one tray icon.
