* Note that iterations 225 and 226 were combined into a single version.

### Platform

- **As mentioned in a previous newsletter, this version will be the last supported Overwolf version for Windows 7/8/8.1.**
    - A warning has been added to the installer as well as the clients of existing affected users.
    - While support for this version will be removed, it will still continue working, and apps can still choose to release updates for it.


### API

- Deprecated API - Deprecated all [Gfycat](/api/deprecated/gfycat) methods, as the site seems to [no longer be running](https://forums.tms.sx/threads/gfycat-is-dead.44691/).
- New API - [overwolf.media.takeScreenshotEX()](/api/media#takescreenshotextargetpath-options-callback) - Allows an app to further control the settings of file-based game screenshots.
  - With the release of this API, file screenshots will now always use the `.jpeg` or the `.bmp` file formats. Screenshots taken before this version however, will always use the `.jpg` format.
- New API - [overwolf.utils.createLogsZip()](/api/utils#createlogszipcallback) - Allows an app to create a local logs.zip from the local users' logs, as opposed to just creating and uploading it directly to the server.
- Updated API - Added the [`GetRunningGameInfoResult.elevated`](/api/games#getrunninggameinforesult-object) field, which indicates whether the running game is running with elevated permissions (Aka Running as Administrator).
- Updated API - Improved the clarity of the exception thrown when selecting an unsupported encoder in [StreamSettings](/api/streaming#streamsettings-object) - now uses the [CaptureErrorCode.UnsupportedEncoder](/api/streaming#captureerrorcode-enum) error code.


### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue involving app overlay enablement for newly targeted games.
- Fixed an issue where app windows would occassionally freeze when trying to open a new window.
- [overwolf.notifications.showToastNotification()](/api/notifications#showtoastnotificationargs-callback) will no longer fail if passed an empty `buttons` array.
- Downloading an app through an app [test channel](/tools/developers-console/all-applications/release-management/testing) whose name contains a space (` `) character will no longer download the app's public version instead.
- Drag resizing an in-game window will no longer get stuck when releasing the drag outside of the game's screen.
- Game-specific hotkeys will no longer ignore settings changes on the next overwolf start.
- Fixed an issue with the enable overlay notification not showing in some cases.
- [`overwolf.extensions.io.delete()`](/api/extensions/io#deletespace-path-callback) will no longer throw an error when passing in an empty file path.
- Fixed a bug where `overwolf.social.*.shareEx()` and `overwolf.social.*.share()` methods would fail when trying to share a `.jpeg` image.
