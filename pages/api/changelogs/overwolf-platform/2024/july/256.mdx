### API
- Added the [`overwolf.media.replays.changeVolume()`](/api/media/replays#changevolumeaudiooptions-callback) method, will change the volume of the Game/Mic audio sources.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where Overwolf would not load properly if `OverwolfBrowser.exe` was run as admin.
- Fixed a visual mismatch between HDR recording in Overwolf and HDR recording in OBS Studio.
- Fixed an issue where the microphone could be heard on all audio tracks when it was set to volume 0 at the start of the recording.
- Fixed an issue where duplicate audio/monitor sources were created when using the replays and streaming services together.
- Fixed an issue where replays volume was set to 100 even when the volume was set to 0.
