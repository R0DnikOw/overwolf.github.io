### Platform
- Added support for Intel's AV1 encoder.

### API
- Added the [`overwolf.utils.openNativeFolderPicker`](/api/utils#opennativefolderpicker)
  method, will open Windows' native folder picker dialog for selecting a folder.

- Added the [`overwolf.utils.openNativeFilePicker`](/api/utils#opennativefilepicker)
([+4 override](/api/utils#opennativefilepicker)) method, will open Windows' native file picker dialog for selecting a file.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where `ExitOverwolfOnExit` would close Overwolf when other apps
  were still running.
