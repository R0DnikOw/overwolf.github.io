### Platform
- When running an App installer of an already installed App, the App will now be launched.

### API
- Added the [`overwolf.windows.requestOverlayFocus`](/api/windows#requestoverlayfocuscallback)
  ([+1 override](/api/windows#requestoverlayfocuswindowid-callback)) method, allowing an App to grab
  focus from the game on very specific scenarios (for use in moderation in specific cases).
- Added the [`overwolf.settings.games.enableOverlay`](/api/settings/games#gameclassid-callback) method,
  allowing Apps to implement a method for users to enable Overlay for a supported game through an explicit
  user action (namely, clicking a button).
- Upgraded the [ow-obs](/api/general/obs) version:
  - Added support for recording with the `AV1 Encoder`.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where Event data could carry over when launching a game while another game is running.
- Fixed an issue where game windows would sometimes become unclickable in specific Exclusive Mode games.
- Fixed an issue where opening the settings window for a specific game would not scroll to that game's entry.
