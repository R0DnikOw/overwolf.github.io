## March 26th 2024 - Users and Permissions Bite 2

*The following is the changelog for an upcoming Developers' Console update, scheduled to release in the coming days.*

Continued the overhaul of the Console's permissions system, bringing the relevant changes into the UI as well. This means:
- Organization (also known as Partner within the console) Owners can now directly add/edit the permissions of their organization
members from the console, on a per-app basis. Currently, the supported roles are:
  - Member (Required) - Allows basic access to the App and its non-fincancial dashboards.
  - Release Tester (Coming soon) - Allows the user to upload versions to App test channels.
  - Release Manager - Allows the user to upload versions to all App channels, as well as edit the App's test channels.
  - Finance - Allows the user access to the App's financial dashboards.
  - Support for more specific/granular roles is now also supported. For specific requests, feel free to [contact us](/support/contact-us)

This release is the second part of the larger move towards overhauling the Developers' Console's
approach to managing Permissions - giving better, more granular control over individual user permissions -
while also striving to streamline the different ways developers interact with the Console as a whole.

For the first bite of this update, see [Users and Permissions Bite 1](/api/changelogs/developers-console/2024/february#february-28th-2024---users-and-permissions-bite-1)
