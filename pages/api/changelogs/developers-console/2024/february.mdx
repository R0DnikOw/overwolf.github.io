## February 28th 2024 - Users and Permissions Bite 1

Significantly overhauled the console's permissions system. This version mostly includes:
- Created infrastructure for more granular control over permissions in an App, including but not limited to permissions for:
  - Viewing financial App data
  - Releasing new App versions
  - Managing App channels
  - Managing App permissions
  - Etc
- Allows App/organization owners to more easily define and control permissions for users working with them
- Many backend improvements to ensure a smooth and reliable experience.

This release is part of a larger move towards overhauling the Developers' Console's approach to managing Permissions -
giving better, more granular control over individual user permissions - while also striving to streamline the different ways
developers interact with the Console as a whole.
