## November 22nd 2023 - Discord Rich Presence

We have released a new page, discussing different recommendations regarding [Discord integrations](/topics/integrations/discord),
to help you get started with integrating cool features into your App that will interact with a user's Discord client. This section
is still a work in progress, and will most likely change and grow over time.

## November 20th 2023 - Tebex-Overwolf Subscriptions API

We have released the first bite of the new [Overwolf Subscriptions API](/start/monetize-your-app/subscriptions) documentation,
as well as the API itself.

With this, we hope to allow App developers an easier way to utilize subscriptions in their Apps,
leading to higher income, leading to better Apps.
