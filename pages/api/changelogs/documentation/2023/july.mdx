## July 6th 2023 - OBS Docs First Bite

We have released a new page in the documentation, over at [OBS](/api/general/obs).  
This page, similarly to the rest of the `General APIs` category, is meant to document `Overwolf OBS` as a tool, including its different APIs:
- Regardless of platform (`Overwolf Platform`/`Overwolf Electron`)
- Regardless of the containing API ([`overwolf.media.replays`](/api/media/replays)/[`overwolf.streaming`](/api/streaming)).  
Over time, more and more of the shared documentation will be moved there.

Do also note the new "Display JSON" component detailing the list of supported Encoders, as it will slowly be rolled out to more and more of the site over time.
