## October 31st 2023 - Update to Analytics Guidelines

Following the deprecation of [Google Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en), we have
decided to update our [App Analytics Guidelines](/topics/integrations/app-analytics) page, since much of it revolved around
that specific integration, which is no longer viable. Instead, the page now describes general best practices,
with links to recommended resources for further reading.

With this, we hope that you will have an easier time reading up on, and working with, App analytics,
empowering you to make better, safer Apps, tailored exactly to your users' needs.
